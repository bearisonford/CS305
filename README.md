Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

    Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops financial plans for their clients.  They wanted to update their software and ensure required
    security practices were met.
    
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software 
security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

    One thing that I felt that I did well when I found my client's software security vulnerabilities was identifying exactly what caused that vulnerability
    and creating a course of action to correct the vulnerability.  It is important to code securely because it provides protection to sensative information,
    prevents damage to the system or client, and builds trust.  

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

    Running the dependency report was helpful to me by referencing a database of known vulnerabilities.  This reduced the amount of dependencies that needed
    to be verified manually to only those that returned with a potential vulnerability.
    
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

    In order to increase layers of security I updated outdated dependencies, implemented message encryption, and implemented a checksum authentication
    function as requested by the client.  In the future I would continue to use OWASP, Maven dependency checks, and code reviews to assess vulnerabilities
    and determine what mitigation techniques to use.
    
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you 
introduced new vulnerabilities?

    In order to check to see whether I introduced new vulnerabilities and to make certain the code and software application were functional and secure
    I reran a dependency check, as well as completed a code review.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

    Using the OWASP database, along with a Maven depenency check, was helpful in finding vulnerabilities and verifying if there were false positives.  I feel
    these will be helpful in future assignments or tasks.  As I branch out in the computer science field and take on more projects security will become
    a larger part of software requirements.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show 
future employers from this assignment?

    In order to show my skills, knowledge, and experience to future employers I would use the completed Practices for Secure Software Report.  I would
    use this report due to the fact that it demonstrates my ability to use encryption, a checksum, evaluating requirements, and providing justification
    for my course of action.
